        When the scrap post brought me on board their software was in shambles.
        I quickly started cleaning up the mess by first auditing the code,
        then fixing all the failing test. Once the code was in a decent state,
        I was tasked with adding an advanced search widget, fixing performance
        issues (n+1 queries, database indexing issues, JS memory leaks, etc) as
        well as other various things.
